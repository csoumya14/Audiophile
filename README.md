### Setup

To run this project locally

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
# or
yarn && yarn dev
```

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- TypeScript
- React-Hook-Form

### What I learned

I gained experience in utilizing the useReducer hook for state management, enhancing my understanding of managing complex application states. While I had primarily relied on Flexbox in the past, this project allowed me to explore CSS Grid extensively, broadening my knowledge of its various capabilities. Additionally, I deepened my expertise in page layout design while working with Next.js.

### Continued development

I would like to add animation to the project as well as create unit tests.
